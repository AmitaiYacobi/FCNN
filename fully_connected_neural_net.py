# data extraction:
#   - extract results columns
#   - create new data (new csv file) without the results colunms
#   - clone the data from the file to a pandas table - optional (I will check this out)
# feed forward:
#   - initial weights accoding to some weights initialization method
#   - feed the layers with the row including the calculation of the 
#     non-linear function. 
#   - print the expected result and the current result.
#   - keep the result (the layer of the result will be
#     represented as 10 neourons)
# back propogation:
#   - execute the back propogation algorithm according to the result
#   - updtate the weights accordingly.
#   - after finishing iterating the whole data, calculate the accuracy of the
#     epoch and write it to a file.
